> We are full stack serverless developers, we are creating a mobile application for stack serverless developers. 

Startup Support Chat: [Discord](https://teleg.run/reactnativeunicorn)

Where I invite volunteers, from Junior level, to its creation.

# The main tasks of the mobile application:

## 1. To employ
In the application, you can create a resume, apply for a vacancy and receive an offer from the employer.

## 2. Solve problems
Developers can describe their problems that they face in the process of developing mobile applications on react-native and get expert help on them.

## 3. Motivate to solve problems
For successfully provided technical support, a unicorn is issued to the developer, from the number of which a programmer rating is formed, which in turn increases their chance of receiving a more attractive offer from employers.

## 4. Teach React Native + GraphQL + AWS Amplify Technology Stack
Based on the code written for this application, and laid out in Open Source, a Full Stack Serverless training course is created in the React Native + AWS Amplify + GraphQL stack. At this point in time, which is the most progressive technology stack, allowing you to create secure mobile applications many times faster.

## Current AWS Amplify Feature Set:

üì¶ Easy CI CD / hosting / custom domains

üõ¢ Serverless DBs & functions

ü§ñ ML & AI

üì± GraphQL

üìä Analytics

üíª Offline & RT

üì£ Chat

üïã Storage

‚ö°Ô∏è Push Notifications

# Workflow
Practice is enough for any level, from layout of components to custom hooks.
The work is carried out according to the Kanban development management method, the board is available [here](https://github.com/react-native-village/aws-amplify-react-hooks/projects/1).

## Tasks are divided into three types of difficulty:

- UI - layout and creation of components

- Screens & Navigation - composition of screens from UI components

- Logic - business application logic

Choose a task for yourself from the backlog column and coordinate it with me in the [chat](https://discord.gg/Ntuttww) of working on the application or suggest your task

Design the layout of the application in [Sketch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixqgri05i2mtu6p/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9.sketch?dl=0)
